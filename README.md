# xcom2-random-appearance-button

This is an XCOM 2 mod. It adds two buttons to the soldier customization menu (both in the character pool and in-game) which create random looks for the given soldier: one generates "reasonable looking soldiers" (by user request) and one generates totally random "clown soldiers" (which was the initial design). It also comes with a (large, hideable) UI element that allows locking traits in place, switching the soldier's gender, and an Undo button, all by user request.
