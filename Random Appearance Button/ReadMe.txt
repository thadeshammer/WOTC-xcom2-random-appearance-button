By popular request, here's a random appearance generating button.

Check off the attributes you want to lock then click the button to roll the dice. There are a lot of options, so they're hidden by default: click the "Toggle Options" button to see them all.

Voice and Attitude aren't currently rolled for; they could be but it didn't make sense to me. If you all disagree and really want them on there, let me know. :)
